**Gallery D'Art** is a single page application for storing and sharing images in a virutal database. This app was inspired by the needs of artists to showcase their work in times of social distancing. Images uploaded to the database are shared in the main gallery along side the work of other artists. Viewing an artist profile will give users more details about the artist, their contact information for art inquiries and contract work, and a gallery view featuring all of that artist's work.

**Planning, Process and Problem Solving Strategy**

We approached this project by breaking it down into a set of smaller taksks that could be completed in daily sprints which we assigned and tracked in a project plan through development. We would meet in the morning to agree on tasks and meet mid-day to guage progress and mob-program any issues anyone on the team was having. We used this approach until near the end of development when we we only had a few small issues left and we split our team of four into two groups to tackle these issues including building development of aws image upload functionality and editing user and art profiles.
